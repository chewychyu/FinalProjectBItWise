        "Meditation is the act of holding grasp of your consciousness."
        <br></br>
        There are a lot of ways to pratice this- as far as I have  knowledge on 'or' as far as I have praticed, concentrating on your breathing in and out , on the sound of the environments, 
        to be precised, on the top middle inner lining of your nose. 
        <br></br>
        I will try to differentiate the three methods I have used, and will promise not to be biased.
        <br></br>
        Why should you believe me or why should you be reading this article from the first place?
        I will give you the answer and introduce myself. Ever since I was as young as 4 years old, my mother 
        would take me to the meditation centers, which I would call summer camps since we spend  good week in there.
        The tradition repeated until I was 16 years old. I have memorized all the Buddha's teaching and ways to live
        by the age of 7 even though I couldn't really understand them until later. As mentioned, I am not making this
        about religion because believe me, I am still a free believer after all these years I spent surrounded by Buddhism ( I 
        would blame it to modern Theravada believers and news rules they have set over the years but that is still another
        topic I will not cover in this article.) There comes but. But, since all my experiences are linked with Buddhism, the contents
        will be most filled with Buddhism pratices, all the right ones and the wrong ones. It is indeed your quiz to guess at the end which one 
        are and aren't. Nevertheless, I will focus on teaching you the defination of this pratice.
        <br></br>
        Now that I tried to give myself justification to be writing this, the next comes the first way I have praticed meditataion. 
        *Focusing on your in and out breathing and accepting things as they are.
        <br></br>
        When I first arrived to the camp (yes we are going with it), if only somebody told me ahead that I will be waking up at 3AM 
        in the morning everyday. After the rushing hours(10 minutes), we head to the main building made specifically for meditation.
        Oh yes, you are correct. The whole place is made for meditation and mindfulness. But the building was the main. It was a spacial 
        hallroom with overhead lights of god knows how many yellow and white lightbults. What I wanted to mention here is walking consciousness.
        When we cross from the dorm to the main buidling, you are to be mindful of every steps you take. Advanced, 
        <br></br>
        the moment you lift your right heel, 
        <br></br>
        the moment of your right foot stepping forward, 
        <br></br>
        the moment your right foot is on the ground, 
        <br></br>
        repeat with left foot, 
        <br></br>
        repeat everytime you take a step.
        <br></br>
        This is the example of grasping your consciousness. Or mindfulness is the other term. To concentrate on the thing you are currently 
        doing right now without letting any other thoughts penerate your consciousness is hard. Which is also the reason why I was taught to accept 
        everything that is going on. Do not look at it in social level. Self (which does not exist) is the  part you should be aware and reative to.
        For instance, when I think of an event that has potential to branch off to many  other thoughts, I was taught to see it as it is, "I am trying to think" 
        "I am trying to think" "I am trying to think". Another instance is when I develop physical detects, I tend to think "It is itching" "It is itching"
        "It is itching" "My back hurts" "My back hurts" "My back hurts". The wonderful experience I had here in this part is, the itch, the pain, the thought, the heat,
        they all disappear after some times. The silence of mind and the peace remained. Then the Dukha (the suffering) cycles.
        <br></br>
        Where is the main point of this article you may ask. I agree I am not a very directive writer. Thank you for your patience, I will explain the first method to 
        meditate now. Why meditation when you can be mindful too everthing you're doing in your life? This is the fastest way to achieve the partial consciousness so 
        come along if you are still with me.
        <br></br>
        The act of minding your breath is not as easy as it sounds. The in and out can be determined as how the wind pass through the nostrils or as in how your abdomen 
        expands and contracts. If you are starting out for the first time, I recommend putting both of your palm near your abdomen instead of putting them on your knees.
        By minding the way your belly goes bigger and the way it becomes smaller, you are realizing that you are breathing, and is breathing to live. The start of consciousness 
        is right here. With each breath, you're alive. You will realize how important are the things we perform unconsciously. Once you think you start to catch the wind passing 
        through your nostrils, it is time to see the wind. The wind goes in , and out of the nostrail. Repeated trillions of times by now. Start to feel it's temperature, 
        the wind sill be a bit cool when we inhale but a bit warm when we exhale. This is what more percentage is oxygen and less percentage of oxygen do. Our biological body is 
        serving this daily yet we tend to put it in our unconsciousness, we tend to forget. When the distractions come, absorb them all. See them as they are. It is a bird singing.
        It is the childern playing. It is someone talking loudly on a phone. It is a construction. Remember to lose the pronouns I, Me, My, Mine when you are meditation. It is not my 
        mother that is tallking loudly on the phone. It is someone, it is a person, a person who I will not claim to be mine while meditation. She is just another biological being. 
        Lose the self and everything relating to self. Why? In short answers, I would say it is to prevent further branches of thoughts but if you want a long answer on this topic from me,
        it will take another article.
